# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Spiritual harm and abuse has begun to gain the attention of the clinical and psychological research community. Research to date has tried to define spiritual harm and abuse and document damage to its victims. The Spiritual Harm and Abuse Scale (SHAS) [@KochEdstrom2022] has been developed to measure spiritual harm and abuse. This study aims to further validate the SHAS by using the Rating Scale Model.
