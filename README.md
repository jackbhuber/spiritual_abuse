# Validation of the Spiritual Harm and Abuse Scale (SHAS) with the Rating Scale Model

Spiritual harm and abuse has been a serious problem that has begun to gain the attention of the clinical and psychological research community. Some research has attempted to define spiritual harm and abuse and documented lasting emotional and psychological damage to victims of spiritual abuse. A valid scale of spiritual and religious abuse is needed, and the nascent Spiritual Harm and Abuse Scale (SHAS) has potential to meet this need. (Koch & Edstrom, 2022) developed an item pool and conducted an initial validation study of the SHAS which established the multidimensional structure of the item pool. This study builds on Koch & Edstrom (2022) to further validate the SHAS by using the Rasch Rating Scale Model.
