    "text": "Spiritual and religious abuse has been a serious problem which is gaining the attention of the psychological research community.\nResearch to date has attempted to define spiritual abuse. Spiritual abuse can include a wide range of psychologically controlling behaviors. It can include diverse emotionally abusive behaviors such as rejecting, isolating, terrorizing, ignoring, corrupting, verbally assaulting, and over-pressuring (Pearl, 1994). It can include sexual or other physical forms of abuse by a clergy member (Doyle, 2006). Spiritual abuse may include theologically sanctioned mistreatment of a group of people such LGBTQ+ persons (Foster et al., 2015). Spiritual abuse can range in specificity from abusive acts by religious leaders to abuse perpetrated by a religious group or person representing a religious group with a religious or spiritual component (Swindle, 2017). Spiritual abuse can also include quoting scripture or invoking divine rationale for mistreatment (Lv. Oakley et al., 2018). Koch & Edstrom (2022) define spiritual abuse broadly as “a type of emotional and psychological abuse perpetrated by a religious leader or group and/or with a religious or spiritual component, usually involving coercion or control.”\nSpiritual and religious abuse has serious negative effects (L. R. Oakley & Kinmond, 2014; Stevens et al., 2019; Swindle, 2017; Ward, 2011). Spiritual and religious abuse can be traumatic, and such trauma that occurs in a religious or spiritual setting may deprive victims of religion and spirituality as a coping strategy. Religious leaders may be on a par with parents in their potential for abusive harm. There are also concerns related to secondary trauma for clinicians working with R/S abused clients (Gubi & Jacobs, 2009).\nIn light of these concerns, a valid scale of spiritual harm and abuse is needed. Practitioners who treat clients who may be victims of religious and spiritual abuse need an instrument to assess the extent and severity of spiritual abuse suffered by a client. Researchers need a reliable measurement of spiritual abuse to examine relationships between spiritual abuse and any number of other psychological, health, or other measures.\nOne promising instrument is the nascent Spiritual Harm & Abuse Scale (SHAS) (Koch & Edstrom, 2022). These authors drew from a recent unpublished scale of religious and spiritual abuse (Keller, 2016), other scales of abuse (Briere & Runtz, 1989; Carlson et al., 2011; Kira et al., 2008; Sanders & Becker-Lausen, 1995), and interviews with victims of abuse to document a wide range of experiences and emotional states that could be described as spiritual harm and abuse. From this work they developed a pool of 66 prompts for an online community survey which they fielded in 2021. Exploratory factor analysis of the data revealed six factors which the authors used to distill the instrument to a 27-item scale with six subscales.\nIn this paper, we further validate the SHAS by using item response theory. Item response theory can enhance clinical assessments in several ways. First, IRT provides interval-level measures which are more appropriate for statistical analysis than ordinal-level sum scores and factor scores. Second, IRT provides one scale along which both items and persons can be located. Third, measurements derived from IRT are sample-free. This means it is possible to estimate a person’s level of the latent construct free of the distribution of individual items and to estimate an item’s difficulty level free from the distribution of people used in the sample. Finally, IRT improves upon single overall reliability coefficients like Cronbach’s alpha by providing examination of precision across the score continuum.\nThe goal of this study was thus to use the Rating Scale Model (Andrich, 1978) to validate the SHAS in several ways. First, we aimed to express the SHAS as a single interval-level outcome measure of cumulative lifetime severity of spiritual harm and abuse. Second, we aimed to enrich the diagnostic value of the items and scale by examining severity. Third, we aimed to examine the distribution of item severities to see where the scale provides the most precise, reliable measurement of spiritual abuse. Such a scale also lays the foundation to further develop the SHAS by identifying anchor items that can calibrate with pilot items on future forms. Finally, we aimed to establish a SHAS score that is free of differential item functioning based on race, gender, and other demographic variables.\n\n\n\n\nAndrich, D. (1978).

The authors validated the construct of spiritual harm and abuse through literature review (Kvarfordt, 2010; Nobakht & Dale, 2017; Oakley & Kinmond, 2014; Rodríguez-Carballeira et al., 2015; Swindle, 2017; Ward, 2011; Winell, n.d.) and interviews with survivors of religious and spiritual abuse. These interviews revealed an array of specific examples of potential abuse not described in the published literature such as abuse inflicted by narcissistic persons, financial coercion, developmentally inappropriate children’s teachings, pressure to stay in physically abusive marriages, neglect of needed medical care, sexual discrimination, and shunning/shaming, among others. The authors generated items by drawing from publicly available measures of similar constructs and by writing new items to maximize construct coverage. Each item they adapted to measure either a potentially spiritually abusive event (inflicting emotional abuse by a religious leader or group and/or with a religious or spiritual component, usually involving coercion or control) or a theorized effect of spiritual abuse, based on the reports of self-described survivors of spiritual abuse in the qualitative literature. In developing items, the authors sought to balance construct coverage with alternate wording and efficiency for participants. They wanted to cover as much of the domain as possible in a survey that could be completed in 15 minutes.",

To qualify for the survey, participants had to be at least 18 years of age and to have identified themselves as Christian in the past (Koch & Edstrom, 2022).\nThe second author used snowball sampling to recruit participants to the study. He promoted the survey through various podcast feeds (in audio form during a podcast episode), e-mail lists, Facebook groups, and other online groups associated with progressive Christian podcasts based in the United States. Listeners/readers were encouraged to invite others who satisfied the criteria to take part in the survey. The second author also posted the link on his own social media accounts with a similar encouragement to invite others who satisfied the study criteria. The sampling priority was to reach the largest, most inclusive, community sample. Participants were consented before beginning the survey. The study was approved by the IRB at Northwest University. Data collection began on January 28, 2021 and concluded on February 27, 2021.",

These included items asking whether the respondent was raised in a Christian home, denomination (and demographics of membership and leadership) in which the respondent experienced abuse, current weekly consumption of progressive Christian podcast episodes, current religious identification, current theological identification, and current view of the Bible.\n\n\nSpiritual Harm and Abuse Items\nThe final survey instrument included a total of 66 prompts separated into two distinct categories (Koch & Edstrom, 2022). The first section, External Events, included 52 prompts about potentially abusive experiences. Prompts in this section measured prevalence by asking “How often have you experienced the above in a church or Christian group setting?” and providing participants a Liker scale of five response categories: (1) Never, (2) Once or twice, (3) Sometimes, (4) Often, and (5) All the time. The large number of prompts in this first section were presented in a randomized order so that all prompts would receive responses by approximately the same number of participants even if many participants did not complete all of the prompts in this section.\nThe second section, Internal States, included 14 prompts about personal feelings resulting from the abusive experiences described in the first section. Prompts in this section measured prevalence by asking “At any point, how often have you experienced the above as a result of negative religious experiences?” Participants were provided the same 5-point Likert scale of response categories as in the first section: (1) Never, (2) Once or twice, (3) Sometimes, (4) Often, and (5) All the time.",

    "section": "Data Analysis",
    "text": "Data Analysis\nIn their initial validation of the SHAS, Koch & Edstrom (2022) examined the dimensionality of the 66 items. The authors used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the factor structure of the items. In these EFA analyses, the items loaded onto six inter-related factors of eigenvalues of at least 1. This enabled the authors to distill the item pool from 66 to 27 items and to identify several meaningful subscales for potential future use by clinicians and researchers.\nFor this study, we focused on the commonality of the items in order to use item response theory to establish a single interval scale of spiritual abuse. Item response theory models make two assumptions: (1) a single latent trait explains responses to items (unidimensionality) and (2) after controlling for this latent trait, items are weakly correlated (local independence) (Embretson & Reise, 2000; Reise, Bonifay, et al., 2013; Reise & Waller, 2009). The SHAS items were multidimensional by design. The construct of spiritual harm and abuse is not conceptually narrow, and to cover the breadth of this construct, Koch & Edstrom (2022) wrote two distinct item sets. However, a unidimensional IRT model can be appropriately fit to multidimensional data (Reise, Moore, et al., 2013). In this study we hypothesized a general factor of spiritual abuse as the primary cause of responses to the full set of 66 SHAS items. We therefore sought evidence of unidimensionality and local independence in order to calibrate the items and participants to a single IRT scale.\nWe began by examining classical item statistics to identify poorly functioning items based on extreme values of skew and kurtosis and low item-total correlations. Then we conducted several analyses of dimensionality in search of sufficient evidence of unidimensionality and local independence. This included principal components analysis to compare the eigenvalues of the largest and second largest components. Like factor analysis, component analysis attempts to summarize the common variance in items by identifying a smaller set of latent sources of covariation. Principal components analysis differs from factor analysis by treating all of the common variance among the items as the total variance to be explained [verify this]. We estimated a unidimensional Rasch model and calculated the proportion of variance in the data it explained. This we followed with a Principal Components Analysis of Residuals (PCAR) to gauge the importance of components in the item residuals, and with a similar statistic, Q3 (“Effects of Local Item Dependence on the Fit and Equating Performance of the Three-Parameter Logistic Model,” 1984), to further inspect the correlations among item residuals.\nWe estimated a Rating Scale model (Andrich, 1978) to the SHAS items. We began by examining plots of the category characteristic curves of the items to visualize step parameters. Then we turned to item severity parameters and item fit statistics to inspect the technical quality of the items. We examined an item-person map to understand the fit of the items to the participants. We concluded by assessing the fit of the model to the data.\nFinally, we conducted differential item functioning (DIF) analysis of the items to examine item bias by gender, and age, and race. [We applied logistic ordinal regression with IRT scoring. We used the Chi-squared likelihood-ratio statistic as the initial DIF detection criteria (alpha &lt; 0.01), and a cut-off of McFadden pseudo R2Δ ≥ 0.02 in model comparisons to determine substantial DIF, a reasonable threshold used in the development of self-reported health outcomes.]\nWe conducted all analyses in R (R Core Team, 2024). We used the psych (Revelle, 2024) and eRm (Mair et al., 2024) packages for analyses of dimensionality, the mirt (Chalmers, 2024) and TAM (Robitzsch et al., 2024) packages for Rating Scale analyses, and the lordif package for DIF analyses.\n\n\n\n\nAndrich, D.

Over 60% view the Bible as divinely inspired if not to be interpreted literally.\nTable 2: Religious Characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nN = 3,222\n1\n\n\n\n\nRaised in Christian home\n2,795 (91%)\n\n\n    Unknown\n161\n\n\nDenomination of most abuse\n\n\n\n\n    Non-denominational\n751 (25%)\n\n\n    Baptist\n585 (19%)\n\n\n    Charismatic/Pentecostal\n448 (15%)\n\n\n    Mainline\n316 (10%)\n\n\n    Christian other than above\n301 (9.9%)\n\n\n    Mormon\n130 (4.3%)\n\n\n    Christian school or university\n124 (4.1%)\n\n\n    Catholic\n118 (3.9%)\n\n\n    Evangelistic/Missions organization\n110 (3.6%)\n\n\n    College Christian organization\n55 (1.8%)\n\n\n    Christian group other than the above\n49 (1.6%)\n\n\n    Local Bible study or small group\n23 (0.8%)\n\n\n    Christian Youth Organization\n15 (0.5%)\n\n\n    Orthodox Christian\n11 (0.4%)\n\n\n    Christian media company\n8 (0.3%)\n\n\n    Christian political/activist group\n3 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    Christian aid/social services group\n0 (0%)\n\n\n    Unknown\n175\n\n\nRacial makeup of abusive community\n\n\n\n\n    Predominantly white\n2,632 (87%)\n\n\n    Mixed race\n356 (12%)\n\n\n    Predominantly people of color\n54 (1.8%)\n\n\n    Unknown\n180\n\n\nRacial makeup of abusive group leadership\n\n\n\n\n    Predominantly white\n2,807 (92%)\n\n\n    Mixed race\n184 (6.0%)\n\n\n    Predominantly people of color\n53 (1.7%)\n\n\n    Unknown\n178\n\n\nGender makeup of abusive group leadership\n\n\n\n\n    All male\n1,253 (41%)\n\n\n    Mostly male\n1,129 (37%)\n\n\n    Mixed gender\n639 (21%)\n\n\n    Mostly female\n24 (0.8%)\n\n\n    All female\n3 (&lt;0.1%)\n\n\n    Unknown\n174\n\n\nInvolvement in abusive group\n\n\n\n\n    7 - Strongly agree\n1,529 (50%)\n\n\n    6\n503 (16%)\n\n\n    5\n328 (11%)\n\n\n    1 - Strongly disagree\n290 (9.5%)\n\n\n    4\n174 (5.7%)\n\n\n    2\n121 (4.0%)\n\n\n    3\n109 (3.6%)\n\n\n    Unknown\n168\n\n\nCurrent religious identification\n\n\n\n\n    Protestant\n1,833 (60%)\n\n\n    Nothing in particular\n518 (17%)\n\n\n    Agnostic\n325 (11%)\n\n\n    Atheist\n128 (4.2%)\n\n\n    Orthodox Christian\n79 (2.6%)\n\n\n    Catholic\n66 (2.2%)\n\n\n    Mormon\n57 (1.9%)\n\n\n    Other religious tradition\n51 (1.7%)\n\n\n    Unknown\n165\n\n\nCurrent theological identification\n\n\n\n\n    5\n477 (23%)\n\n\n    4 - In the midddle\n468 (23%)\n\n\n    6\n384 (19%)\n\n\n    3\n263 (13%)\n\n\n    7 - Very liberal\n191 (9.4%)\n\n\n    2\n175 (8.6%)\n\n\n    1 - Very conservative\n72 (3.5%)\n\n\n    Unknown\n1,192\n\n\nCurrent view of Bible\n\n\n\n\n    The Bible is the inspired word of God but not everything should be taken literally, word for word\n2,010 (66%)\n\n\n    The Bible is an ancient book of fables, legends, history and moral precepts recorded by man\n870 (28%)\n\n\n    The Bible is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally, word for word\n174 (5.7%)\n\n\n    Unknown\n168\n\n\n\n1\nn (%)",

    "text": "Initial Item Analysis\nIn Table 3 we report classical statistics for the 66 SHAS items. We sorted the items by their mean. We flagged six items due to extreme values of skew (less than -2 or greater than +2) or kurtosis (less than -7 or greater than +7) and item-total correlations below 0.50. These included items EQ17, EQ27, EQ41, EQ46, EQ55, and EQ60. Category response proportions show that most people responded “Never” to these items. Thus, because these items do not apply to the vast majority of people in this population, we removed them from the item pool. This reduced the pool from 66 to 59 items.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Classical Item Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nn\nmean\nsd\nskew\nkurtosis\nItem-total correlation\nflag\n\n\n\n\nEQ46 - Treated as less than because of my skin color\n0.94\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0.00\n3,211\n1.11\n0.48\n5.15\n28.93\n0.16\n*\n\n\nEQ41 -

    "text": "Unidimensionality and Local Independence\n\nPrincipal Components\nWe first analyzed the principal components in the 59 SHAS items. As shown in Figure 1, the first component was large, accounting for nearly 30% of the variance. The second, third, and fourth components accounted for 4%, 3%, and 2% of the variance, respectively. The ratio of the eigenvalue of the first (largest) component to that of the second is approximately 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Principal Components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProportion of Variance\nSecond, we estimated a unidimensional Rasch model on dichotomized responses to the 59 SHAS items and saved the residuals of the person parameters. We calculated the variance in the observed item responses and the variance of the residuals. Reckase (1979) suggests that the unidimensionality assumption is safely met if the Rasch model explains 20% of the variance in the data. In this case, the proportion of variance in the SHAS item data explained by the Rasch model was .23. Thus, the SHAS data meet this criterion.\n\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis of Residuals (PCAR)\nNext, we examined the principal components of the correlations among residuals of the Rasch analysis. The premise is that once the Rasch model has been estimated, correlations among the item residuals should be minimal. Linacre () suggests that contrasts with eigenvalues of 2.0 or below can be considered noise. In Figure 2, our PCAR analysis found only one contrast that rose above that 2.0 threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Contrasts from PCA of Standardized Residual Correlations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3\nFinally, we calculated the Q3 statistic “Effects of Local Item Dependence on the Fit and Equating Performance of the Three-Parameter Logistic Model” (1984) to examine correlations among item residuals, the premise being that the latent trait should account for so much common variance in the item responses that any net correlations among the items should be weak. The Q3 statistic index criteria are that the raw residual correlation between pairs of items should never exceed 0.10 (Marais & Andrich, 2008). Of the 1,711 item pairs, the mean correlation was -0.017 with a standard deviation of 0.035. Thus, most of the residual correlations among items were very weak. Figure 3 plots the matrix of correlations between item residuals. Each square depicts a correlation. The squares are shaded in grey with the lightest shade indicating the weakest correlations. As hoped, the vast majority of squares are very light, indicating weak correlations among the item residuals.\n\n\n\nWLE Reliability= 0.918 \nYen's Q3 Statistic based on an estimated theta score \n*** 60 Items | 1770 item pairs\n*** Q3 Descriptives\n     M     SD    Min    10%    25%    50%    75%    90%    Max \n-0.017  0.036 -0.109 -0.055 -0.040 -0.020 -0.001  0.025  0.321 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Correlation Matrix of Item Residuals",

    "section": "Rasch Rating Scale Analysis",
    "text": "Rasch Rating Scale Analysis\nWe used the Rasch Rating Scale Model (RSM) (Andrich, 1978) to examine the SHAS item pool. The RSM is a Rasch model (Rasch, 1960) that combines (or “calibrates”) information from items with information from persons to arrive at a common scale for measuring both an item’s and a person’s level of a latent trait, in this case, severity of spiritual abuse. This scale is expressed in logits (log odds units). Whereas the Rasch model was designed for use with dichotomous items (0 = incorrect response, 1 = correct response), the RSM is an extension for use with polytomous items based on rating scales such as Likert scales of agreement (Embretson & Reise, 2000).\nWe also use different language from conventional IRT analyses. Because IRT was developed to measure student achievement, IRT statistics for both items and persons tend to use language of “ability” and “difficulty.” For our purpose to measure a psychological trait such as the experience of spiritual abuse, we chose instead to adopt language of “severity.” We used person parameters and scale scores to represent participants’ severity of abuse and to describe item parameters as severity parameters.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(stats4)\nlibrary(lattice)\nlibrary(mirt)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'mirt'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:eRm':\n\n    itemfit, personfit\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ltm':\n\n    Science\n\nlibrary(WrightMap)\n\nThe RSM estimates the probability of a person choosing among several response options (i.e. Never, Once or twice) given two values: the severity of abuse represented by the item, and the person’s severity of the latent trait (spiritual abuse). The increase in severity involved in choosing between two response categories is called a “step parameter”. The RSM makes two assumptions of the response categories. One is that all items use the same rating scale. The other is that the same response categories distinguish persons equally well for each item. For these reasons the RSM estimates the same step parameters for all the items.\nTo convey this information visually, ?fig-RM-plot1 and ?fig-RM-plot2 are plots of the category response functions of two items. In both, the horizontal axis is the scale of spiritual abuse expressed in logits ranging from -2 to +2. The vertical axis is the probability of selecting a given response (i.e., “Always”) given the person’s overall severity of spiritual abuse. The blue line is the probability of selecting Category 1 (“Never”) for persons with less severe spiritual abuse. Persons with less severe spiritual abuse are most likely to select “Never” while those with more severe abuse are most likely to select “Always.” Between these two extremes are persons with more moderate or average spiritual abuse. These persons are more likely to Categories 3 or 4, “Sometimes” or “Often”, respectively. Both plots show curves that display identical step parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots point out a step reversal between “Never” and “Once or twice”. Persons reporting the least severe spiritual abuse were most likely to report “Never” to this prompt of medical care being postponed or withheld for religious reasons. Persons farther along the scale who have experienced “average” average spiritual abuse should be more likely to report “Once or twice” but were still more likely to report “Never”. This finding suggests the “Never” and “Once or twice” categories might be collapsed.\n\nItem Severity Parameters and Fit Statistics\n?tbl-RSM-item-tbl reports item parameters and fit statistics for the SHAS items. The first column, xsi, reports the severity parameter of the item, and we have sorted the items by this value from least to most severe to facilitate comparison between items. ?tbl-RSM-item-tbl also reports fit statistics for the items. These statistics reflect how closely the observed patterns of item responses fit the patterns of item responses predicted by the RSM. These fit statistics are chi-square statistics which examine the cumulative difference the observed pattern of item responses and the pattern of item responses that the model would expect.\nTwo fit statistics commonly used in IRT models are the infit mean square and the outfit mean square (Bond & Fox, 2015). The infit statistic places greater emphasis on unexpected responses that are close to the persons and item location. The outfit is sensitive to unexpected responses that are far from the location. The expected value of infit or outfit for each item is 1.0, with a range of acceptable values ranging from 0.5 to 1.5. Values outside these boundaries indicate a lack of fit between items and the model. All but one of the 60 items had infit and outfit statistics within the acceptable range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliability\nThe RSM expresses internal consistency reliability as Rasch person separation. Based on Table X, the SHAS has a high Rasch person separation reliability value of .963, indicating that the estimated RSM scale discriminated well between persons with varying severity of spiritual abuse.\nThe SHAS also has a high Rasch item separation reliability with Rel = .XX, χ2 (XX) = XXXX.X, p &lt; .XX, implying that the items have a good spread in terms of item ordering and hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem-Person Map\n?fig-RSM-WrightMap displays an item-person map (also called a “Wright map”) that shows the item severities of the SHAS items and the person severities for each person who completed the survey. All these severities are estimated in logits (log odds units) as the unit of measures. This means the higher the logit value for an item is, the less likely it was for a person to endorse that particular item. On the other hand, higher logit values for each person indicate more severe spiritual abuse. On the variable map, the mean item severity is constrained to be 0.00 with person severities being relative to that mean item severity While column 1 shows the latent continuum in terms of logit values as the unit of measurement underlying the SHAS, columns 2 and 3 represent the severities of the people and the items.\n?fig-RSM-WrightMap shows good overlap between the person trait and item severity as evidenced by the match between the mean of the person severity (M = − 0.58) and the mean of the item severity (M = 0.00). This suggests that the majority of the items were appropriate for the sample. While person severity measures range from X.XX logits to − X.XX logits (M = − 0.XX, SD = 0.XX, N = XXXX), the item severities range from X.XX logits to − X.XX logits (M = X.XX, SD = 0.XX, N = XXXX). The item representing the most severe spiritual abuse for participants is Item X, “I feel … XXX” with the severity at X.XX logits (also reported in Appendix Table 2). By contrast the item representing the least severe spiritual abuse is item XX, “I would …”, with − 1.08 logits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel-Data Fit\nTo assess the overall fit of the RSM to the SHAS item response data, we use two statistics. The first is the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The suggested cutoff for RMSEA is .06. The second is the CFI. The suggested cutoff for the CFI is .95. These fit statistics are presented in Table RSM Model Fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe obtained RMSEA value of .09 (95% CI[.092, .093]) exceeds the cutoff of .06. The CFI of .953 meets the recommended .95 threshold. Together these statistics evidence that the RSM fits the SHAS items.",

    "section": "DIF Analysis",
    "text": "DIF Analysis\nDifferential item functioning (DIF) examines how an item functions differently for people of equal standing on the trait. In this case, we conducted DIF analysis of the SHAS items to examine item bias by gender, and age, and race. [We applied logistic ordinal regression with IRT scoring. [We used the Chi-squared likelihood-ratio statistic as the initial DIF detection criteria (alpha &lt; 0.01) and a cut-off of McFadden pseudo R2Δ ≥ 0.02 in model comparisons to determine substantial DIF, a reasonable threshold used in the development of self-reported health outcomes.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this analysis, we examined the degree to which there was evidence of uniform differential item functioning (DIF) between two subgroups of participants (group 1 and group 2). As a first step we examined item severity estimates and standard errors specific to each subgroup using the Rating Scale Model Andrich (1978). We estimated item severity for the two subgroups using a combined analysis of both subgroups and then estimating the group-specific item severities and standard errors are shown in Table X.\nTo examine the differences in item severity between subgroups, we calculated standardized differences following Wright and Masters (1982) as follows:\n[equation]\nwhere\nz is the standardized difference, d1 is the item severity specific to Subgroup 1, d2 is the item severity specific to Subgroup 2,\ns e 2 1 is the standard error of the item severity specific to Subgroup 1, and\ns e 2 2 is the standard error of the item severity specific to Subgroup 2. Using the formulation of the z statistic, higher values of z indicate higher item locations (more-severe to endorse) for Subgroup 1 compared to Subgroup 2.\nFigure X shows a plot of the z-statistics for the four items; these values are also presented numerically in Table X. In the figure, the x-axis shows the item identification numbers, and the y-axis shows the value of the z-statistic. Boundaries at +2 and -2 are indicated using dashed horizontal lines to highlight statistically significant differences in item severity between subgroups. Examination of these results indicates that the items were not significantly different in severity between the two subgroups. In addition, there were both positive and negative z statistics, indicating that although the differences in item severity were not significant, there were some items that were easier to endorse for Subgroup 1 and others that were easier to endorse for Subgroup 2.\nFigure 1: Plot of Standardized Differences for Items between Subgroups\nTo further explore the differences in item severity between the two subgroups, Figure 2 shows a scatterplot of the item locations between the two subgroups. In the plot, the item severity for Subgroup 1 is shown on the x-axis, and the item severity for Subgroup 2 is shown on the y-axis. Individual items are indicated using open circle plotting symbols. A solid identity line is included to highlight deviations from invariant item severities between the two groups: Points that fall below this line indicate that items were easier to endorse (lower item measures) for Subgroup 2, and points that fall above the line indicate that items were easier to endorse (lower item measures) for Subgroup 1. Dashed lines are also included to indicate a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the item measures, following Luppescu (1995).\nFigure 2: Scatterplot of Subgroup-Specific Item Severities\nFinally, Figure 3 is a bar plot that illustrates the direction and magnitude of the differences in item severities between subgroups. In the plot, each bar represents the difference in severity between subgroups for an individual item, ordered by the item sequence in the survey. Bars that point to the left of the plot indicate that the item was easier to endorse for Subgroup 1, and bars that point to the right of the plot indicate that the item was easier to endorse for Subgroup 2. Dashed vertical lines are plotted that show values of +0.5 and -0.5 logits as an indicator of substantial differences in item severity between subgroups.\nFigure 3: Bar Plot of Differences In Item Severity Between Subgroups\n\n\n\n\nAndrich, D.

    "text": "Implications and future directions\nThis study presents the validation of the SHAS using the Rasch measurement model, for assessing spiritual abuse in adults. The findings have important implications for clinicians and researchers who are concerned about spiritual abuse. The finding that the majority of the SHAS items were of high quality implies that the items provide adequate information to measure moderate levels of spiritual abuse. However, we found the SHAS less able to distinguish people with very high and low levels of spiritual abuse. Hence, for now clinicians and researchers should be cautious when interpreting their results for people who have very high and low spiritual abuse levels.\nWe echo the same limitations of these data noted in @KochEdstrom2022. The SHAS was developed on a largely white and Protestant/former Protestant population. Possibly major types or sub-themes of spiritual abuse not captured here are more prominent in other religious traditions. This would be a fruitful area of future study. Research into spiritual abuse among the LGBTQ+ community might also yield insights specific to that population. Future research could also distinguish normed scores of this scale for different populations and denominations.\nThe final screener has the potential to both improve therapy for innumerable clients who have experienced negative religious experiences and to contribute a knowledge base for any future clinical training around working with spiritually abused clients. The scale may also contribute to future research that could be critical in understanding not only the mechanisms and experience of spiritual abuse but also perhaps the enduring power of religion, both to heal and to harm.",
